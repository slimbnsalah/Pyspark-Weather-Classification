# Weather Classification using PySpark

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on various weather features using PySpark.

## Introduction

This project utilizes PySpark, a powerful data processing and machine learning library, to build a weather classification model. The model is trained on historical weather data and is capable of predicting whether it will rain tomorrow based on a set of input features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- PySpark (version 3.4.0)
- Pandas
- NumPy
